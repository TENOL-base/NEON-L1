# NEON L-1
[Прочитайте этот документ на Русском](README_RU.md)

NEON L-1 is an educational 8-bit processor designed for students and hardware enthusiasts who want to understand how a CPU works at the lowest level.

The processor is equipped with more than 200 LEDs that visualize its internal signals, buses, and flip-flops in real time. This allows users to literally see how data moves inside the processor during instruction execution.

One of the key features of NEON L-1 is manual clock control. This makes it possible to execute programs step by step and observe how each instruction is processed at the hardware level, making the processor especially suitable for learning and demonstrations.

NEON L-1 focuses on clarity, transparency of operation, and educational value rather than performance.

## Hardware architecture
The NEON L-1 processor is implemented as a modular system consisting of six separate printed circuit boards.
Each board represents a distinct functional unit of the processor, allowing students to study and debug
individual parts of the CPU independently.

The processor is divided into the following hardware modules:

- Program Counter module
- Instruction Processing module
- Memory module
- Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU)
- Address Control module
- I/O Port Control module

## Technical Specifications
- Architecture: 8-bit
- Maximum EEPROM size: 64 KB
- Maximum RAM size: 8 KB
- Maximum stack size: 256 bytes
- I/O ports: 2 bidirectional 8-bit ports
- Maximum clock frequency: 500 kHz
- Minimum clock frequency: Unlimited

## Project status
The NEON L-1 processor is currently under active development.
The project is divided into six hardware modules.

1. Logisim CPU design — 2 / 6 modules completed  
2. DipTrace schematics — 0 / 6 modules completed  
3. DipTrace PCB layout — 0 / 6 modules completed  
4. PCB manufacturing — 0 / 6 modules completed

## Target audience
- High school students (educational use in schools)
- Technical colleges and institutes (students and applied laboratory tasks)
- Universities (computer architecture and digital design courses)
- Hardware enthusiasts (home use by students, hobbyists, and adults)
