# NEON L-1
[Прочитайте этот документ на Русском](README_RU.md)

NEON L-1 is an educational 8-bit processor designed for students and hardware enthusiasts who want to understand how a CPU works at the lowest level.

The processor is equipped with more than 200 LEDs that visualize its internal signals, buses, and flip-flops in real time. This allows users to literally see how data moves inside the processor during instruction execution.

One of the key features of NEON L-1 is manual clock control. This makes it possible to execute programs step by step and observe how each instruction is processed at the hardware level, making the processor especially suitable for learning and demonstrations.

NEON L-1 focuses on clarity, transparency of operation, and educational value rather than performance.
